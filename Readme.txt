This is my 5 quarter final exam (it's basically my final quarter in college and that
makes sad 'cause i munna stop seeing my friends for 4 months, and after that we 
graduate and then we'll never see again. They are my best friends, the first ones
that i had).
This tries to imitate an smarthouse.
We used arduino components to imitate ilumination, garage, doors,
ventilation, night ilumination, etc. And we used raspberry as our server.
We also used a MySQL database, JQuery, PHP and Bootstrap.
I didnÂ´t sleep for many days, and one of the three arduinos failed just once
our presentation had begun.
We got 9.5/10 so it went better than i think.


sorry for my poor choose of words, but my english is not good.

If you are searching for something alike, well, I hope this can help u.
